## Granger Waste Services
Granger is a waste hauling and landfill company. We have been family owned since 1966. From our humble beginnings to the Granger of today, we’ve maintained our commitment to serving our customers no matter how large or small.
Our mission statement says it all: Granger is a Christian, family business, guided by the Golden Rule, which creates and manages sustainable environmental solutions.
We continue to honor the legacy of service established by the previous generation by striving to live up to it each and every day.

This Github organization is set up for use by the Granger IT department.
